# Docker containers

fnal-wn-sl6, fnal-wn-sl7 and fnal-wn-el7 are containers that provide an environment similar to the one on FermiGrid (actual FermiGrid nodes have only SL7). 
It includes a base Scientific Linux with the xrootd client from OSG.

These images are taken by OSG and distributed as expanded Singularity images on CVMFS.
